            <h2>Perfect Your Accent and Speak Spanish Like a Native!</h2>
            <p>Improving your Spanish pronunciation and fluency is essential to sounding more natural when speaking. By focusing on the correct sounds and practicing regularly, you can make your spoken Spanish clearer, more authentic, and easier to understand. Here are key aspects to focus on:</p>

        <!-- Pronunciation of Vowels Section -->
        <section class="pronunciation">
            <h3>1. Spanish Vowel Pronunciation</h3>
            <p>Spanish vowels are relatively simple compared to English, and their sounds don't change based on accent or word position. Here's how to pronounce each vowel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A:</strong> Always pronounced as "ah" (like in the English "father").</li>
                <li><strong>E:</strong> Always pronounced as "eh" (like in the English "bed").</li>
                <li><strong>I:</strong> Always pronounced as "ee" (like in the English "see").</li>
                <li><strong>O:</strong> Always pronounced as "oh" (like in the English "pot").</li>
                <li><strong>U:</strong> Always pronounced as "oo" (like in the English "moon").</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unlike English, where vowels can be pronounced in various ways, Spanish vowels have a very consistent pronunciation.</p>

        <!-- Pronunciation of Consonants Section -->
        <section class="consonants">
            <h3>2. Consonant Pronunciation Tips</h3>
            <p>Some Spanish consonants are pronounced differently than in English. Here are some important consonants to pay attention to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R:</strong> The "r" in Spanish is a rolled sound. It can be difficult for English speakers, but with practice, you'll master it.</li>
                <li><strong>J:</strong> The "j" is pronounced like a guttural "h" sound (like in the English word "hello"). Example: "jugar" (to play) is pronounced as "hoo-gar."</li>
                <li><strong>C:</strong> The letter "c" can sound like "s" before "e" or "i" (e.g., "cima" - "the top"), but like a "k" sound before "a", "o", or "u" (e.g., "cafÃ©" - "coffee").</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

            <h3>5. Cultural Tips to Sound More Like a Native</h3>
            <p>Understanding the culture behind the language will make your speech sound more natural and fluent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expressions and Idioms:</strong> Learn common Spanish idioms and expressions to sound more like a native. For example, "Â¡QuÃ© guay!" (How cool!) or "Estar en las nubes" (To be daydreaming).</li>
                <li><strong>Speaking at the Right Speed:</strong> In many Spanish-speaking countries, people speak quickly. However, itâ€™s important to be aware of the speed at which you speak so that others can understand you.</li>
                <li><strong>Politeness:</strong> Spanish speakers often use formal phrases like "Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡ usted?" (How are you, formal?) instead of just "Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?" (How are you, informal?). Being polite is an essential part of Spanish culture.</li>
            </ul>
